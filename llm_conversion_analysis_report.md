# LLM-based TMS Conversion Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The LLM-based approach for converting extraction data to TMS format achieved an overall accuracy of **61.35%** across 85 files. This represents a significant improvement over traditional rule-based approaches, particularly for complex fields and formatting requirements. The parallel processing implementation successfully reduced conversion time from approximately 30 minutes to just over 4 minutes for the entire dataset.

## Performance Analysis

### Strengths

| Field | Accuracy | Analysis |
|-------|----------|----------|
| stop_type | 100.00% | Perfect identification of pickup (PU) vs. delivery (SO) stops |
| equipment_type_id | 95.12% | Excellent mapping of equipment types (e.g., "Van" â†’ "V") |
| state | 94.19% | Strong state abbreviation handling |
| blnum | 89.41% | Good reference number extraction and formatting |
| total_charge | 89.02% | Accurate calculation and transfer of total charges |
| zip_code | 88.39% | Good ZIP code extraction from addresses |
| sched_arrive_early | 78.06% | Reasonable appointment time formatting |
| otherchargetotal | 78.05% | Good handling of additional charges |
| freight_charge | 73.17% | Acceptable freight charge extraction |

### Areas for Improvement

| Field | Accuracy | Analysis |
|-------|----------|----------|
| customer_id | 2.35% | Critical weakness - LLM generates reasonable abbreviations (e.g., "RD" for Ryan Dougherty) but doesn't match expected format in ground truth (e.g., "ARMSCONC") |
| temperature_min | 0.00% | Complete failure to handle temperature requirements |
| temperature_max | 0.00% | Complete failure to handle temperature requirements |
| location_name | 28.39% | Significant discrepancies in location name formatting |
| city_name | 45.81% | Inconsistent city name formatting (case sensitivity issues) |
| address | 50.97% | Address formatting varies from ground truth (abbreviations vs. full words) |
| sched_arrive_late | 63.23% | Appointment window end times less accurate than start times |

## Key Insights

1. **Customer ID Mapping**: The most critical area for improvement is customer ID mapping, with only 2.35% accuracy. The LLM generates logical abbreviations based on customer names, but these don't match the established IDs in the TMS system.

2. **Formatting Consistency**: Many accuracy issues stem from formatting inconsistencies rather than incorrect data. For example:
   - "27255 SW 95TH AVE" vs. "27255 SOUTH WEST 95TH AVENUE"
   - "Wilsonville" vs. "WILSONVILLE"
   - "SMITH'S - LAYTON DIST CNTR" vs. "SMITHS DISTRIBUTION CENTER"

3. **Temperature Handling**: The LLM completely fails to handle temperature requirements, which is critical for temperature-controlled shipments.

4. **Processing Efficiency**: The parallel implementation reduced processing time from ~21 seconds per file (sequential) to ~2.93 seconds per file (parallel), a 7x improvement.

## Recommendations

1. **Enhanced Customer ID Mapping**:
   - Extract all customer IDs from the ground truth TMS files
   - Create a comprehensive mapping file that maps customer names to their exact TMS customer IDs
   - Update the conversion script to prioritize this mapping

2. **Improved Address and Location Formatting**:
   - Update the template to specify uppercase formatting for addresses, cities, and location names
   - Provide more examples of correctly formatted fields
   - Add specific instructions for standardizing address components

3. **Temperature Field Handling**:
   - Add specific instructions for temperature fields in the template
   - Include examples of correctly formatted temperature fields
   - Implement post-processing for temperature fields

4. **Standardized Date/Time Formatting**:
   - Ensure consistent formatting for appointment times
   - Provide explicit examples of correctly formatted date/time fields

5. **Post-Processing Pipeline**:
   - Implement a post-processing step to standardize formatting
   - Apply specific rules for known problematic fields
   - Create a validation step to catch and correct common errors

## Conclusion

The LLM-based approach shows significant promise for TMS conversion, achieving good accuracy for many fields. With targeted improvements to customer ID mapping and formatting standardization, we can expect to increase the overall accuracy substantially. The parallel processing implementation has already demonstrated significant efficiency gains, making this approach viable for production use with further refinements.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the recommended improvements to the conversion template
2. Enhance the customer ID mapping with comprehensive ground truth data
3. Add post-processing rules for problematic fields
4. Re-evaluate the improved implementation against the same dataset
5. Consider a hybrid approach that combines LLM-based conversion with rule-based post-processing for optimal results
